'''
NOTES:
Both tables overlap this means that you need to build in a elif statement on the first try loop because its possible to have a gaia id that doesnt have an
EOM of -1 in table2 but has an EOM -1 in table1....
Additionally all stars can be referenced for their name with TLC but the TLC is negative -1 for some stars in the first table.
int(match_id1)]=='-1' and 
EOM_table2[int(match_id2)]=='-1' and

int(TLC_table1[match_id1])
